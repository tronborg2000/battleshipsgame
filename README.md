## Battleship
Battleship is a simple Python script that allows you to play a game of battleship against the computer.

## Requirements
To run this script, you will need to have Python installed on your computer.

## How to play
To play the game, simply run the battleship.py script. The computer will place two battleships on a 5x5 grid, and you can enter coordinates to try to hit the battleships. If you hit a battleship, the space will be marked with an 'X' and the ship will be removed from the grid. If you miss, the space will be marked with an 'O'. The game ends when all battleships have been destroyed.

## Customizing the game
You can customize the game by changing the values of the GRID_SIZE and NUM_SHIPS variables at the top of the battleship.py script. You can also modify the rules of the game by changing the code in the main game loop.

## Bugs: 

I was getting an error message ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'x2' As I was entering coordinates with an X or Y value before the numbers entered.
